      <description>I love park run. It&amp;rsquo;s been one of the main things i&amp;rsquo;ve missed during the last six, locked down, months. But one thing that&amp;rsquo;s always surprised me is the lack of rigourous information about the difficulty of various park run courses.
There are (or were, pre-pandemic) over 1,000 events uk events. But one event may have a multitude of different courses that are run each week. For example, my local park run Crystal Palace has at least two courses - a summer course that goes through muddy forest and a winter course that sticks to the paths.</description>
