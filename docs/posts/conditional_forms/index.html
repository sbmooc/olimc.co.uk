        <p>I&rsquo;ve recently begun some freelancing with a charity to help them out with some development work. They have a single django app that they use accross the business. Over the past couple of years, I&rsquo;ve worked with django a lot, but always in the context of a DRF powered API and a separate front end. This application is a single monolithic application, using django as it was first designed, &lsquo;batteries included&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I was asked to implement a conditional form where certain questions would only be shown depending on the result of a previous question. This was to support staff in making the right decisions for clients depending on the client&rsquo;s previous answers. I wanted to see if I could entirely do it without using any javascript, which I managed. At the moment, we just need to show users a summary of data and not save any of it, so there are no models associated with it - just a form, a view and a template. The form that I implemented had previously been developed using google forms. As such - there was a simple flow for me to copy, although the form and 14 steps and a number of potential journeys.</p>
<p>I looked around for other&rsquo;s implementations, but most suggested using javascript, or <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43001425/django-modelform-with-conditions">weren&rsquo;t quite what i was looking for.</a></p>
<p>But as a simple demonstration to my implementation, consider this simple conditional flow.</p>
<p>There will be 2 questions in the form:</p>
<ul>
<li>What&rsquo;s your favourite food?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s your favourite topping? or What&rsquo;s your favourite sauce</li>
</ul>
<p>By not using any javascript, it means the user must make a request when completing a question - and the server can then present the next question depending on that questions response.</p>
<p>We are also not using a db to store anything as the user progresses, and we don&rsquo;t want to rely on state being maintained in the server. So we attach previous answers to the next url. As such, you really don&rsquo;t want to use this approach for any sensitive or secure information.</p>
<p>Our form will look something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">PizzaForm</span>(Form):
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span> __init__(self, <span style="color:#f92672">*</span>args, <span style="color:#f92672">**</span>kwargs):
        <span style="color:#66d9ef">pass</span>
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">def</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">_post_clean</span>(self):
        <span style="color:#66d9ef">pass</span>
</code></pre></div><p>And our view will look something like this:</p>
