      <description>I love park run. It&amp;rsquo;s been one of the main things I&amp;rsquo;ve missed during the last six, locked down, months. But one thing that&amp;rsquo;s always surprised me is the lack of rigourous information about the difficulty of various park run courses.
There are (or were, pre-pandemic) over 1,000 events UK events. But one event may have a multitude of different courses that are run each week. For example, my local park run Crystal Palace has at least two courses - a summer course that goes through muddy forest and a winter course that sticks to the paths.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to set up my own site for a while. Lockdown, longer nights, and a job search pushed me to actually do it. But I needed the barrier for setup to be as low as possible, but still give me a platform to grow and build it further. For now, i&amp;rsquo;ll concentrate on the writing - making it look good can come later.
This site is simple. I use the excellent Hugo to generate the html, and host it on github pages.</description>
