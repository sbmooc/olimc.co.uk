I'm a user focused software developer. Before then (summer 2018), I was a business analyst and management consultant.

I currently work as a Senior Software Engineer at [Prolific](https://prolific.com). I also run [Racebuddy](https://racebuddy.co.uk), a platform for ultra distance cycling races (yes it's niche).

When i'm not behind a screen i'm riding my bike, running or watching Charlton Athletic (yes we used to be good, and yes it all went downhill when Alan Curbishley left).
