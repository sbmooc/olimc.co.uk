i'm a user focused software developer.

i've worked as a business analyst and a management consultant.

for the past few months i've been freelancing, and i'm starting a new perm role in january.

i'm building a product to help race organisers administer long distance cycling races - like the transcontinental.

when i'm not behind a screen i'm riding my bike or watching charlton.
