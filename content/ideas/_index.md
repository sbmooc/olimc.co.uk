some license free ideas...

1. A regex puzzle bot on twitter that auto validates responses
2. A mobile app to find the closest pub. Just a compass and the distance - nothing more
3. A twitter extension to easily cite papers / facts within tweets
4. A consultancy to support non tech businesses to use git as version control for key documents
5. Inspired by [this](https://twitter.com/tompeck/status/886887951623442432?lang=en), a twitter bot that reverse image searches photos posted by MPs to check for stock photos
6. A whatsapp bot to build up an evidence base about a certain local subject. E.g. Pavement parking - people can send in photos and it will automatically add to a website that local campaigners can use to show offending.
